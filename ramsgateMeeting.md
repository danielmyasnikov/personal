Goodies taken from Ramsgate meeting:

1. Was given 30 seconds pitch (keep that tight! check before going)
2. Asking other business for help? Asking other businesses procedures and fitting your services into that procedure. For example, Irine (asian lady) was performing SEO and said that it would be nice to have a system in place to optimize her manual work.
3. Keep your KPIs high
4. First thing people look is your linked in.

Questions that I was asked:

1. My tech stack
1.1. What is my DB?
1.2. What is my BE / FE?
1.3. How much of expertise do I have in these technologies?
2. Do I do designs?
No I don't. But I outsource the work to other specialized designers and convert their design work into a workable layouts or if it's not required templates that I have already built can suit your needs.
3. Why did you start?
3.1. Passion to be closer at solving real problems.
3.2. Between 68 - 74 % of IT projects are failures. The reason - technical design decisions. How do you know if you speak with a presentable sales manager that his team is capable of delivering the project. I am  a bad sales person but good @ delivery tech tasks.
4. What are my services?
5. Where did you work?
6. What is your education?

Peoples struggles:

1. Xero and investigation of apps. Think of a xero consultant?
2. SEO System (Iryne)
3. CMS built up solutions? (PK and Irene asked about my CMS) (Irene asked about SEO in other CMSes)

General struggles:

1. Language (ability to speak clearly and fluently over a LONG period of time)
2. Emotions (ability to keep emotions down when feeling pressure)
3. Concentration (keep an eye contact speaking with superiors)
